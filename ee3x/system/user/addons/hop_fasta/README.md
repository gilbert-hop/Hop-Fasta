# Hop Fasta

This accessory puts a "Quick Update" button on the Template editor, right next to the "Save Template" and "Save & Finish Editing" buttons.

If you use the "Quick Update" button, it submits the form in the background, so you don't lose where your cursor is, and you still have to option to undo your work if you don't like the result. Plus it's pretty fast !

Saving with "Quick Update" will create a template revision (if you want it to), and keeps you from having to wait for the whole HTML page to download, so you work faster, better, and easier.
